===========

This repository contains several commits on `master` branch and two on feature branches and helps demonstrate branching and merging Git commands.

I am going my own way.  I want a cookie - chocolate chip! :cookie:

## Usage

* Using `git merge` to integrate branches
* Initiate a Pull Requests from a topic branch
* Create a single commit with `git merge --squash`
* Rewriting history with `git rebase`
